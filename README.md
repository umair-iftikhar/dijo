# Welcome to the DIJO Project!

DIJO - Digital Journal

Digital journal for daily logs

# Why DiJo?

At my job, my day-to-day work involves different small tasks with different projects. Every project has its story and timeline as well that need to be maintained. Because of this, I feel the need for a daily log or daily journal method. I was looking at Bujo - bullet journal. Try to set it in the notebook, but I am not the best person for paper and pen.
